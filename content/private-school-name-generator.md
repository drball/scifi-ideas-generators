Need the name a fictional school? This name generator creates names for fictional schools & academies. 

This random school name generator will also generate names for universities, colleges & other educational institutes & learning centers.

Names are based on real schools in America, Australia & The UK, as well as from fiction, like "Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters", & "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry" from Harry Potter.

Schools are sometimes named after famous people. This generator will sometimes take a name from our <a href="/sci-fi-character-name-generator/">Scifi Character Name Generator</a>, or feel free to replace this with an actual historical person who exists in the canon of your universe.
