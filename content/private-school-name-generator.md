Need the name a fictional private school? This name generator creates names for fictional private schools & academies (in the UK, an academy is an independent state-funded school. This means itâ€™s funded directly by the government rather than by a local authority). 

It will also generate names for random names for universities, colleges & other educational institutes & learning centers.

Names are based on real schools in America, Australia & The United Kingdom, as well as from fiction, like "Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters" from X-men, & "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry" from Harry Potter.

Schools are sometimes named after famous people. This generator will sometimes take a name from our <a href="/sci-fi-character-name-generator/">Scifi Character Name Generator</a>, or feel free to replace this with an actual historical person who exists in the canon of your universe.
