This random flag creator will generate a new flag with random colors & shapes, ideal for a new country or faction. 

The generated flags will have stripes of vertical or horizontal color, & might include a symbol in the center. Use these generated flags as a guide to create a flag for a fictional country, faction, or alien planet for your scifi projects. 

The flag generator is based on code by Luke Haulin. <a href="https://codepen.io/haulin/pen/pBrpRG">See the original Codepen</a>.
