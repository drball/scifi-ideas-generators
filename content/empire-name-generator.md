Need a name for a fictional space empire in your sci-fi story or game? This generator has been designed to help writers & role-players come up with new name for an interstellar space empire, maybe useful for naming your empire in empire-building games like Stellaris.

If you want to generate a random alien species instead, see the <a href="/alien-species-generator">Alien Species Name Generator</a>, & if you need the name of a planet where these aliens live, see our <a href="/planet-name-generator">Planet Name Generator</a>.
