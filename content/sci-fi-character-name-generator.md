The Sci-Fi character name Generator will help you name the human characters in your science fiction stories or games. Maybe ideal for random bridge officers on your spaceship? Or space marines? Or NPCs that you can meet in a bar an alien planet? 

Names generated here come from a big list of Human first names & last names (from across the world & cultures), plus also some generated from scifi books, films, comics etc, also some generated using random syllables for that extra random weirdness. 

If you need a name for an alien character, try our <a href="/alien-name-generator">Alien Name Generator</a>.
