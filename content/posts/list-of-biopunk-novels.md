This article is a list of Biopunk novels & movies. 

<h2>What is Biopunk?</h2>

Biopunk is a subgenre of science fiction & derivative of the cyberpunk movement that focuses on biotechnology & genetic engineering. The word "Biopunk" is a portmanteau of "biotechnology" or "biology" & "punk" (similar to steampunk, cyberpunk, or <a href="/posts/solarpunk-we-are-golden-and-our-future-is-bright/">solarpunk</a>).

Biopunk is derived from cyberpunk, but focuses on the specific implications of synthetic biotechnology instead of computers, software or networks. It usually involves a near-future story of bio-hackers, totalitarian governments or megacorporations misusing biotechnologies, such as manipulating human DNA, cloning, body augmenting etc. 

Usually keeping the dark atmosphere of cyberpunk, a typical biopunk story generally examines the dark side of genetic engineering & represents the dangerous side & downsides of biotechnology.

One of the prominent writers in this field is Paul Di Filippo, although he used the word "ribofunk" to describe his stories, a blend of "ribosome" & "funk".
