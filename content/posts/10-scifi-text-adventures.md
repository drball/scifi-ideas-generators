There's something special about purely text-based games. Without graphics or music, they have only the deliberately chosen words to conjure up the setting in your mind. 

And there's nothing better than your imagination. 

Here's a list of 10 classic text-based scifi games that you might, or might not have heard of. 

<h2>Leather Godesses Of Phobos - 1986</h2>

A comedic DOS game with a racy theme. It definitely doesn't take itself seriously. You start the game in a bar, & head to the toilets when you're abducted by aliens who are planning an invasion of Earth.
