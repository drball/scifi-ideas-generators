<blockquote>“A desolate, dry planet with vast deserts… The planet is Arrakis. Also known as Dune.” <cite>- Princess Irulan, Dune</cite></blockquote>

Desert planets have long been a staple in science fiction. From Arrakis in Dune, to Tattooine in Star Wars. These planets are known for their single type of habitat, a dry, inhospitable desert. 

There's something interesting about a desert, especially to those of us who can't imagine living in or near one. It’s a landscape that’s entirely alien, unimaginable for its lack of water, its alternating boiling & freezing temperatures, it's absence of plant life. The horizon in a desert is so far, that it feels like it stretches into the infinite. Similar to the feeling of being lost at sea, which might make sailors go insane. 

A desert planet is also known as a dry planet, an arid planet, or a Dune planet, is a theoretical type of planet with single type of terrain, hot desert throughout.
