There’s a few sci-fi stories that involve a futuristic race, like Speed Racer, “Sugar Rush” in Wreck-It Ralf, the racetrack in Ready Player One, even the “Kessel Run” described in Star Wars. 

This race name generator will generate a futuristic sounding race name, which you might decide to use in your story/game, for racing motorcars, spaceships etc, maybe even hovercars, whatever! If it's actually the name of an alien race you're looking for, see our <a href="/alien-species-name-generator">Alien Species Name Generator</a> instead
