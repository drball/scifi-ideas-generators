description: "Need a description for a random planet?"
---

There are an estimated 100 billion planets in our galaxy, possibly many more. If you're writing a scifi story about visiting these planets, you might quickly run out of inspiration for how to give them a unique description. 

There have been many different types of planets shown in scifi films & TV programmes. Desert planets, ice planets, rocky planets, water planets. 

Star Trek has the description "M-Class" for an Earth-like planet that can support life. But if you look in science books, there's so much more variation. Planets with a methane atmosphere, gas giants, planets with gravity so strong it can crush you, planets that have tunnels made from lava, planets where it snows titanium oxide. 

Our planet description generator will randomly create a description to inspire you for your writing project. 

<h2>The planet generator is coming soon</h2>
