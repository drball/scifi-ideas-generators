Need a way of generating the name & description of a random alien creature for your story or game?

Say your characters find themselves on an alien planet, they might meet all sorts of wonderous creatures, large & small. This is a generator for creating random alien beasts, vicious creatures which might attack you, or friendly creatures which might come over and lick you. All of the alien creatures in this generator are “beasts” meaning they’re not intelligent. If you want a generator with ideas for alien species & civilisations, see our <a href="/alien-species-generator/">Alien Species Generator</a>, & if you need the name of the planet they live on, use our <a href="/planet-name-generator">Alien Planet Name Generator</a>.
