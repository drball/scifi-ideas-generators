Dwarves are a fictional race of small, stout humanoids. They're often depicted as living in mountains and mines, and are skilled craftsmen and miners. Dwarves are also known for their long beards and their love of gold and jewels.

In Germanic folklore, dwarves are often seen as tricksters and guardians of treasure. 

In Tolkien's Middle-earth, dwarves are a race of skilled craftsmen. They are often seen as being greedy and avaricious, but they are also loyal and brave.
